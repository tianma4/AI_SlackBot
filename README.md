# AI_SlackBot
 AI Slackbot as an IT support assistant. 
 Integrated with OpenAI's text-davinci-003 model and used internal Confluence KB articles to fine-tune the private data. 
 This provides customized responses for first-level support in Slack and improves team efficiency.

 Need Slack, OpenAI and Confluence API Key to make this work.
