How to add a printer to printer list,"Add a printer to your printer list so you can use it on MacTo use a printer, you must add it to your list of printers using Printers & Scanners settings. (If you switched from using a Windows computer to a Mac, using Printers & Scanners settings is similar to using the Printing control panel in Windows. )In most cases, when you add a printer, macOS uses AirPrint to connect to the printer or automatically downloads the printer’s software (also called a printer driver). Don’t install the software that came with the printer or from the manufacturer’s website; follow the instructions in one of the tasks below, and macOS prompts you to download the latest software if it’s needed. For information about using a printer with an iPhone or iPad, see Apple Support article Use AirPrint to print from your iPhone or iPad. Add a USB printerFor most USB printers, all you have to do is update your software and then connect the printer to your Mac. macOS automatically detects the printer and downloads any necessary software. For other printers, you may have to complete a few steps to add the printer. On your Mac, update your printer software: Check with your printer’s manufacturer to see if any updates are available for your printer model. Prepare your printer: Use the instructions that came with your printer to unpack the printer, install ink or toner, and add paper. Turn on the printer and make sure it’s not displaying any errors. Connect your printer: Connect the USB cable to your Mac. If you see a message prompting you to download new software, make sure to download and install it. Important: If your Mac has a single USB-C port, use a multiport adapter. Connect the printer, then connect a USB-C cable to a power supply to prolong the battery life of your Mac. See Use USB-C cables with your Mac. Add a Wi-Fi or network printerIf your Mac and printer are already connected to the same Wi-Fi network, the printer might be available to you without any setup. To check, choose File > Print, click the Printer pop-up menu, choose Nearby Printers or Printers & Scanners settings, then choose your printer. If you don’t see your printer, you can add it. On your Mac, update your printer software: Check with your printer’s manufacturer to see if any updates are available for your printer model. If you have an AirPrint printer, you don’t need to check for software updates. Prepare your printer: Use the instructions that came with your printer to unpack the printer, install ink or toner, and add paper. Turn on the printer and make sure it’s not displaying any errors. Connect your printer: Follow the instructions that came with the printer to connect it to the network. If you have a Wi-Fi printer, you might need to connect the printer to your Mac with a USB cable to set up Wi-Fi printing. After connecting the printer to your Mac, install the Mac software that came with the printer and use the printer’s setup assistant to connect the printer to your Wi-Fi network. After setting up, you can disconnect the cable from your printer and Mac and the printer should remain connected to the Wi-Fi network. See the Apple Support article Connect an AirPrint printer to a Wi-Fi network. Add the printer to your list of available printers: Choose Apple menu > System Settings, then click Printers & Scanners in the sidebar. (You may need to scroll down. )If you don’t see your printer listed on the left, click the Add Printer, Scanner or Fax button on the right. A dialogue appears listing printers on your local network. When your printer appears in the list, select your printer, then click Add. It may take a minute or two for your printer to appear. If you see a message prompting you to download new software, make sure to download and install it. When you add a printer, macOS can usually detect whether the printer has special accessories installed, such as additional paper trays, extra memory or a duplex unit. If it can’t, a dialogue appears that lets you specify them. Make sure the settings in that dialogue accurately reflect your printer’s installed accessories so you can take full advantage of them. Add a network printer by specifying its IP addressIf a network printer you want to use isn’t in the list of available printers, you can add it as an IP printer. The printer must support one of these printing protocols: AirPrint, HP Jetdirect (Socket), Line Printer Daemon (LPD), or Internet Printing Protocol (IPP). Note: Some printers connected using these generic protocols may offer limited functionality. You must know the network printer’s IP address or host name, printing protocol, and model number or printer software name. If it uses a special queue, you also need to know the queue name. See the person who manages the printer or server for assistance. On your Mac, update your printer software: Check with your printer’s manufacturer to see if any updates are available for your printer model. If you have an AirPrint printer, you don’t need to check for software updates. Prepare your printer: Use the instructions that came with your printer to unpack the printer, install ink or toner, and add paper. Turn on the printer and make sure it’s not displaying any errors. Connect your printer: Follow the instructions that came with the printer to connect it to the network. See the Apple Support article Connect an AirPrint printer to a Wi-Fi network.

ProtocolChoose a printing protocol that your printer supports:AirPrint: Use the AirPrint protocol to enable Wi-Fi, USB and Ethernet network access to a printer’s printing and scanning options (if the specific printer supports these features). You don’t need to download or install printer software to use AirPrint-enabled printers. A wide variety of printers, including Aurora, Brother, Canon, Dell, Epson, Fuji, Hewlett Packard, Samsung, Xerox and many others, support the AirPrint protocol. HP Jetdirect – Socket: Use this protocol to access Hewlett Packard and many other printer manufacturers. Line Printer Daemon - LPD: Allows access to some older printers and print servers that use this protocol. Internet Printing Protocol - IPP: Allows access to modern printers and print servers. QueueEnter the queue name for your printer. If you don’t know the queue name, try leaving it blank or see your network administrator. NameRecords a descriptive name for the printer (for example, Colour Laser Printer), so you can identify it in the Printer pop-up menu. LocationRecords the printer’s location (for example, “outside my office”), so you can identify it in the Printer pop-up menu. UseDisplay the appropriate software for the printer. If you don’t see software for your printer, choose Select Software, then select your printer in the Printer Software list. If Printer Software list doesn’t include your printer, try downloading and installing the printer software (also called a printer driver) from the printer manufacturer. You can also try choosing generic postscript or PCL printer software from the pop-up menu depending on your type of printer. Add a Bluetooth printerIf your Mac came with Bluetooth installed, or if you are using a USB Bluetooth adapter, you can print wirelessly to a Bluetooth-enabled printer. On your Mac, update your printer software: Check with your printer’s manufacturer to see if any updates are available for your printer model.

Bazel Installation and Configuration,"This page describes the options for installing Bazel on Ubuntu. It also provides links to the Bazel completion scripts and the binary installer, if needed as a backup option (for example, if you don't have admin access). Supported Ubuntu Linux platforms:20. 04 (LTS)18. 04 (LTS)Bazel should be compatible with other Ubuntu releases and Debian ""stretch"" and above, but is untested and not guaranteed to work. Install Bazel on Ubuntu using one of the following methods:Recommended: Use BazeliskUse our custom APT repositoryUse the binary installerUse the Bazel Docker containerCompile Bazel from sourceNote: For Arm-based systems, the APT repository does not contain an arm64 release, and there is no binary installer available. Either use Bazelisk or compile from source. Bazel comes with two completion scripts. After installing Bazel, you can:Access the bash completion scriptInstall the zsh completion scriptStep 1: Add Bazel distribution URI as a package sourceUsing Bazel's apt repositoryNote: This is a one-time setup step. 
sudo apt install apt-transport-https curl gnupg -y
curl -fsSL https://bazel. build/bazel-release. pub. gpg | gpg --dearmor >bazel-archive-keyring. gpg
sudo mv bazel-archive-keyring. gpg /usr/share/keyrings
echo ""deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/bazel-archive-keyring. gpg] https://storage. googleapis. com/bazel-apt stable jdk1. 8"" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources. list. d/bazel. list
The component name ""jdk1. 8"" is kept only for legacy reasons and doesn't relate to supported or included JDK versions. Bazel releases are Java-version agnostic. Changing the ""jdk1. 8"" component name would break existing users of the repo. Step 2: Install and update Bazel
sudo apt update && sudo apt install bazel
Once installed, you can upgrade to a newer version of Bazel as part of your normal system updates:
sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade
The bazel package always installs the latest stable version of Bazel. You can install specific, older versions of Bazel in addition to the latest one, such as this:
sudo apt install bazel-1. 0. 0
This installs Bazel 1. 0. 0 as /usr/bin/bazel-1. 0. 0 on your system. This can be useful if you need a specific version of Bazel to build a project, for example because it uses a . bazelversion file to explicitly state with which Bazel version it should be built. Optionally, you can set bazel to a specific version by creating a symlink:
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/bazel-1. 0. 0 /usr/bin/bazel
bazel --version # 1. 0. 0
Step 3: Install a JDK (optional)Bazel includes a private, bundled JRE as its runtime and doesn't require you to install any specific version of Java. However, if you want to build Java code using Bazel, you have to install a JDK. 
# Ubuntu 16. 04 (LTS) uses OpenJDK 8 by default:
sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk# Ubuntu 18. 04 (LTS) uses OpenJDK 11 by default:
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk
Using the binary installerGenerally, you should use the apt repository, but the binary installer can be useful if you don't have admin permissions on your machine or can't add custom repositories. The binary installers can be downloaded from Bazel's GitHub releases page. The installer contains the Bazel binary and extracts it into your $HOME/bin folder. Some additional libraries must be installed manually for Bazel to work. Step 1: Install required packagesBazel needs a C++ compiler and unzip / zip in order to work:
sudo apt install g++ unzip zip
If you want to build Java code using Bazel, install a JDK:
# Ubuntu 16. 04 (LTS) uses OpenJDK 8 by default:
sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk# Ubuntu 18. 04 (LTS) uses OpenJDK 11 by default:
sudo apt-get install openjdk-11-jdk
Step 2: Run the installerNext, download the Bazel binary installer named bazel-version-installer-linux-x86_64. sh from the Bazel releases page on GitHub. Run it as follows:
chmod +x bazel-version-installer-linux-x86_64. sh. /bazel-version-installer-linux-x86_64. sh --user
The --user flag installs Bazel to the $HOME/bin directory on your system and sets the . bazelrc path to $HOME/. bazelrc. Use the --help command to see additional installation options. Step 3: Set up your environmentIf you ran the Bazel installer with the --user flag as above, the Bazel executable is installed in your $HOME/bin directory. It's a good idea to add this directory to your default paths, as follows:
export PATH=""$PATH:$HOME/bin""
You can also add this command to your ~/. bashrc or ~/. zshrc file to make it permanent. Using the Bazel Docker containerWe publish Docker container with Bazel installed for each Bazel version at gcr. io/bazel-public/bazel. You can use the Docker container as follows:
$ docker pull gcr. io/bazel-public/bazel:<bazel version>
The Docker container is built by these steps. ",4750
Data Request Runbook,"A webhook allows an external service to start a particular runbook in Azure Automation through a single HTTP request. External services include Azure DevOps Services, GitHub, Azure Monitor logs, and custom applications. Such a service can use a webhook to start a runbook without implementing the full Azure Automation API. You can compare webhooks to other methods of starting a runbook in Starting a runbook in Azure Automation. NoteUsing a webhook to start a Python runbook is not supported. To understand client requirements for TLS 1. 2 with webhooks, see TLS 1. 2 for Azure Automation. Webhook propertiesThe following table describes the properties that you must configure for a webhook. PropertyDescriptionNameName of the webhook. You can provide any name you want, since it isn't exposed to the client. It's only used for you to identify the runbook in Azure Automation. As a best practice, you should give the webhook a name related to the client that uses it. URLURL of the webhook. This is the unique address that a client calls with an HTTP POST to start the runbook linked to the webhook. It's automatically generated when you create the webhook. You can't specify a custom URL. The URL contains a security token that allows a third-party system to invoke the runbook with no further authentication. For this reason, you should treat the URL like a password. For security reasons, you can only view the URL in the Azure portal when creating the webhook. Note the URL in a secure location for future use. Expiration dateExpiration date of the webhook, after which it can no longer be used. You can modify the expiration date after the webhook is created, as long as the webhook hasn't expired. EnabledSetting indicating if the webhook is enabled by default when it's created. If you set this property to Disabled, no client can use the webhook. You can set this property when you create the webhook or any other time after its creation. Parameters used when the webhook starts a runbookA webhook can define values for runbook parameters that are used when the runbook starts. The webhook must include values for any mandatory runbook parameters and can include values for optional parameters. A parameter value configured to a webhook can be modified even after webhook creation. Multiple webhooks linked to a single runbook can each use different runbook parameter values. When a client starts a runbook using a webhook, it can't override the parameter values defined in the webhook. To receive data from the client, the runbook supports a single parameter called WebhookData. This parameter defines an object containing data that the client includes in a POST request. The WebhookData parameter has the following properties:PropertyDescriptionWebhookNameName of the webhook. RequestHeaderHashtable containing the headers of the incoming POST request. RequestBodyBody of the incoming POST request. This body keeps any data formatting, such as string, JSON, XML, or form-encoded. The runbook must be written to work with the data format that is expected. There's no configuration of the webhook required to support the WebhookData parameter, and the runbook isn't required to accept it. If the runbook doesn't define the parameter, any details of the request sent from the client are ignored. NoteWhen calling a webhook, the client should always store any parameter values in case the call fails. If there is a network outage or connection issue, the application can't retrieve failed webhook calls. If you specify a value for WebhookData at webhook creation, it's overridden when the webhook starts the runbook with the data from the client POST request. This happens even if the application doesn't include any data in the request body. If you start a runbook that defines WebhookData using a mechanism other than a webhook, you can provide a value for WebhookData that the runbook recognizes. This value should be an object with the same properties as the WebhookData parameter so that the runbook can work with it just as it works with actual WebhookData objects passed by a webhook. For example, if you're starting the following runbook from the Azure portal and want to pass some sample webhook data for testing, you must pass the data in JSON in the user interface. For the next runbook example, let's define the following properties for WebhookData:WebhookName: MyWebhookRequestBody: *[{'ResourceGroup': 'myResourceGroup','Name': 'vm01'},{'ResourceGroup': 'myResourceGroup','Name': 'vm02'}]*Now we pass the following JSON object in the UI for the WebhookData parameter. This example, with carriage returns and newline characters, matches the format that is passed in from a webhook. JSONCopy
{""WebhookName"":""mywebhook"",""RequestBody"":""[\r\n {\r\n \""ResourceGroup\"": \""vm01\"",\r\n \""Name\"": \""vm01\""\r\n },\r\n {\r\n \""ResourceGroup\"": \""vm02\"",\r\n \""Name\"": \""vm02\""\r\n }\r\n]""}
NoteAzure Automation logs the values of all input parameters with the runbook job. Thus any input provided by the client in the webhook request is logged and available to anyone with access to the automation job. For this reason, you should be cautious about including sensitive information in webhook calls. Webhook securityThe security of a webhook relies on the privacy of its URL, which contains a security token that allows the webhook to be invoked. Azure Automation doesn't perform any authentication on a request as long as it's made to the correct URL. For this reason, your clients shouldn't use webhooks for runbooks that perform highly sensitive operations without using an alternate means of validating the request. Consider the following strategies:You can include logic within a runbook to determine if it's called by a webhook. Have the runbook check the WebhookName property of the WebhookData parameter. The runbook can perform further validation by looking for particular information in the RequestHeader and RequestBody properties. Have the runbook perform some validation of an external condition when it receives a webhook request. For example, consider a runbook that is called by GitHub any time there's a new commit to a GitHub repository. The runbook might connect to GitHub to validate that a new commit has occurred before continuing. Azure Automation supports Azure virtual network service tags, specifically GuestAndHybridManagement. You can use service tags to define network access controls on network security groups or Azure Firewall and trigger webhooks from within your virtual network. Service tags can be used in place of specific IP addresses when you create security rules. By specifying the service tag name GuestAndHybridManagement in the appropriate source or destination field of a rule, you can allow or deny the traffic for the Automation service. This service tag doesn't support allowing more granular control by restricting IP ranges to a specific region. Create a webhookNoteWhen you use the webhook with PowerShell 7 runbook, it auto-converts the webhook input parameter to an invalid JSON. For more information, see Known issues - PowerShell 7. 1 (preview). We recommend that you use the webhook with PowerShell 5 runbook. Create PowerShell runbook with the following code:PowerShellCopy
param
(
[Parameter(Mandatory=$false)]
[object] $WebhookData
)
write-output ""start""
write-output (""object type: {0}"" -f $WebhookData. gettype())
write-output $WebhookData
#write-warning (Test-Json -Json $WebhookData)
$Payload = $WebhookData | ConvertFrom-Json
write-output ""`n`n""
write-output $Payload. WebhookName
write-output $Payload. RequestBody
write-output $Payload. RequestHeader
write-output ""end""
if ($Payload. RequestBody) {
$names = (ConvertFrom-Json -InputObject $Payload. RequestBody)
foreach ($x in $names)
{
$name = $x. Name
Write-Output ""Hello $name""
}
}
else {
Write-Output ""Hello World!""
}
Create a webhook using the Azure portal, or PowerShell or REST API. A webhook requires a published runbook. This walk through uses a modified version of the runbook created from Create an Azure Automation runbook. Azure portalPowerShellREST APISign in to the Azure portal. In the Azure portal, navigate to your Automation account. Under Process Automation, select Runbooks to open the Runbooks page. Select your runbook from the list to open the Runbook Overview page. Select Add webhook to open the Add Webhook page. On the Add Webhook page, select Create new webhook. Enter in the Name for the webhook. The expiration date for the field Expires defaults to one year from the current date. Click the copy icon or press Ctrl + C copy the URL of the webhook. Then save the URL to a secure location. ImportantOnce you create the webhook, you cannot retrieve the URL again. Make sure you copy and record it as above. Select OK to return to the Add Webhook page. From the Add Webhook page, select Configure parameters and run settings to open the Parameters page. Review the Parameters page. For the example runbook used in this article, no changes are needed. Select OK to return to the Add Webhook page. From the Add Webhook page, select Create. The webhook is created and you're returned to the Runbook Overview page. Use a webhookThis example uses the PowerShell cmdlet Invoke-WebRequest to send the POST request to your new webhook. Prepare values to pass to the runbook as the body for the webhook call. For relatively simple values, you could script the values as follows:PowerShellCopy
$Names
= @(
@{ Name=""Hawaii""},
@{ Name=""Seattle""},
@{ Name=""Florida""}
)
$body = ConvertTo-Json -InputObject $Names
For larger sets, you may wish to use a file. Create a file named names. json and then paste the following code::JSONCopy
[
{ ""Name"": ""Hawaii"" },
{ ""Name"": ""Florida"" },
{ ""Name"": ""Seattle"" }
]
Change the value for the variable $file with the actual path to the json file before running the following PowerShell commands. PowerShellCopy
# Revise file path with actual path
$file = ""path\names. json""
$bodyFile = Get-Content -Path $file
Run the following PowerShell commands to call the webhook using the REST API. PowerShellCopy
$response = Invoke-WebRequest -Method Post -Uri $webhookURI -Body $body -UseBasicParsing
$response
$responseFile = Invoke-WebRequest -Method Post -Uri $webhookURI -Body $bodyFile -UseBasicParsing
$responseFile
For illustrative purposes, two calls were made for the two different methods of producing the body. For production, use only one method. The output should look similar as follows (only one output is shown):The client receives one of the following return codes from the POST request. CodeTextDescription202AcceptedThe request was accepted, and the runbook was successfully queued. 400Bad RequestThe request wasn't accepted for one of the following reasons:The webhook has expired. The webhook is disabled. The token in the URL is invalid. 404Not FoundThe request wasn't accepted for one of the following reasons:The webhook wasn't found. The runbook wasn't found. The account wasn't found. 500Internal Server ErrorThe URL was valid, but an error occurred. Resubmit the request. Assuming the request is successful, the webhook response contains the job ID in JSON format as shown below. It contains a single job ID, but the JSON format allows for potential future enhancements. JSONCopy
{""JobIds"":[""<JobId>""]}
The PowerShell cmdlet Get-AzAutomationJobOutput will be used to get the output. The Azure Automation API could also be used. PowerShellCopy
#isolate job ID
$jobid = (ConvertFrom-Json ($response. Content)). jobids[0]
# Get output
Get-AzAutomationJobOutput `
-AutomationAccountName $automationAccount `
-Id $jobid `
-ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup `
-Stream Output
When you trigger a runbook created in the previous step, it will create a job and the output should look similar to the following:Update a webhookWhen a webhook is created, it has a validity time period of 10 years, after which it automatically expires. Once a webhook has expired, you can't reactivate it. You can only remove and then recreate it. You can extend a webhook that hasn't reached its expiration time. To extend a webhook, perform the following steps. Navigate to the runbook that contains the webhook. Under Resources, select Webhooks, and then the webhook that you want to extend. From the Webhook page, choose a new expiration date and time and then select Save. Review the API call Webhook - Update and PowerShell cmdlet Set-AzAutomationWebhook for other possible modifications. Clean up resourcesHere are examples of removing a webhook from an Automation runbook. Using PowerShell, the Remove-AzAutomationWebhook cmdlet can be used as shown below. No output is returned. PowerShellCopy
Remove-AzAutomationWebhook `
-ResourceGroup $resourceGroup `
-AutomationAccountName $automationAccount `
-Name $psWebhook
Using REST, the REST Webhook - Delete API can be used as shown below. PowerShellCopy
Invoke-WebRequest -Method Delete -Uri $restURI -Headers $authHeader
An output of StatusCode : 200 means a successful deletion. Create runbook and webhook with ARM templateAutomation webhooks can also be created using Azure Resource Manager templates. This sample template creates an Automation account, four runbooks, and a webhook for the named runbook. Create a file named webhook_deploy. json and then paste the following code:JSONCopy
